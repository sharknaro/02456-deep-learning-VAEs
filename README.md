# Semi-Supervised-Learning-for-protein-isoform-prediction
This repository provides the data, model scripts, and project report which are used to investigate the prediction performance of using a semi-supervised learning method consisting of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) for the prediction of protein isoform expressions.
