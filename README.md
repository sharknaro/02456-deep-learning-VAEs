# Prediction-of-protein-isoform-by-semi-supervised-learning
This repository provides the data, model scripts, and project report which are used to investigate the prediction performance of using a semi-supervised learning method consisting of a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and feed forward neural network for the prediction of protein isoform expressions.
